Site aim

This website was created as a fictional club of Ski Cross enthusiasts and/or people who wanted to discover the sport especially after the Winter Olympics. The scope in terms of audience ranges from those who are completely new to the sport to those who want to find a community of other people interested in the sport where they can share their passion.

The site has 4 pages in total built using HTML and CSS only. Details of the pages are described below.

This is the first of 5 projects as part of the Web Development Diploma from Codeinstitute and was inspired by the project done previously with guidance called "Love Running".

Requirements:

This project required creating a static website and documenting its progress through GitHub containing key functionalities and features such as a nav bar, links and images/video.

Color scheme:

The color scheme for the website was relatively simple using 2 main colours throughout, these were whitesmoke (rgb(245,245,245) and slightly lighter shade of black (rgb(7, 1, 20)) in varying degrees of opacity to contrast and fir in with the skiing/snow theme.


Fonts:

The fonts used were taken from Google Fonts and applied throughout the project.

The font used for headings was Josefin Sans and for other blocks of text was Josefin Slab. This combination was suggested on the following forum/website: https://www.freshwateragency.com/4-great-google-font-pairings/
