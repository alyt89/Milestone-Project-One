Site aim

This website was created as a fictional club of Ski Cross enthusiasts and/or people who wanted to discover the sport especially after the Winter Olympics. The scope in terms of audience ranges from those who are completely new to the sport to those who want to find a community of other people interested in the sport where they can share their passion.

The site has 4 pages in total built using HTML and CSS only. Details of the pages are described below.

This is the first of 5 projects as part of the Web Development Diploma from Codeinstitute and was inspired by the project done previously with guidance called "Love Running".

Requirements:

This project required creating a static website and documenting its progress through GitHub containing key functionalities and features such as a nav bar, links and images/video.

Color scheme:

The color scheme for the website was relatively simple using 2 main colours throughout, these were whitesmoke (rgb(245,245,245) and slightly lighter shade of black (rgb(7, 1, 20)) in varying degrees of opacity to contrast and fir in with the skiing/snow theme.


Fonts:

The fonts used were taken from Google Fonts and applied throughout the project.

The font used for headings was Josefin Sans and for other blocks of text was Josefin Slab. This combination was suggested on the following forum/website: https://www.freshwateragency.com/4-great-google-font-pairings/

Site features:

Header and Navigation:

The header contains the site's name (Ski Cross Club) in the largest font to clearly indicate to site visitors the name of the site and is maintained across the 4 pages of the site for consistency. 

The navigation bar section allows customers to navigate to the other pages on the site, the current page the user is on is shown by the underline styling.

The hero image for the  page begins at the top of each page and sits behind the header/navigation bar and continues below showing a person skiing in the background.

The hero image has an overlay applied with an absolute positioning to allow the white text to contrast more pleasingly for better user experience.

There is an animation applied to the tagline for the website "Join the club discover ski cross" to draw the user's attention each time the page loads. The code required to animate this section has been duly credited in the CSS file.

On the Events, Gallery and Sign Up pages there is no animation applied but the page summary is positioned and sized the same way with a small description underneath.


Aim and history section:

This section is intended to give the user an idea of what to expect from Ski Cross Club and its current stature. The section reconfirms that it is intended for various levels of ability and age.

The history is important to allow the user to know what to expect from the club as it is quite new and growing.

The section maintains the same colour scheme and has a background image of a skier with their ski's in a cross formation.

What is Ski Cross section:

This section is inteded to give those with less of a knowledge of winter sports and in particular skiing what the sport is and what it involves. The section aims not only to inform but encourage users to discover more and get involved.


Visual navigation links:

This section is inteded to reinforce the nav bar at the top of the page as this is not fixed so users would have to scroll up to find this otherwise.The images provide a further visual clue to what the page they are clicking on will contain. Each image has an effect when hovered over to come into focus before the user clicks.


Footer:

The footer is the same across the 4 pages of the website and contains links to the 3 social media platforms to find out more information.

The links have been coloured suitably as per the company's logo.

Events page:

The events page contains 8 upcoming events to give users information about where, when and what the club is planning for the remainder of the year.

The events details section provides additional basic information that is applicable to all events the user would want to know before registering their interest in one of the events via the sign up form. This includes the equipment that is provided and information on how to register their interest.

Sign up form:

The form is intended to collect the basic information from the user where they can specify which events they are interested in.

There is a minimal amount of information required to enter to encourage the user to send their details and hear back from the club so they can start to get involved.

Once submitted the form redirects the user to a page to confirm the information has been captured successfully and will receive and email in due course.

Contact information:

The club's email address for any other questions is provided in another section below the form consistent with the styling on previous pages.
