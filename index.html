    <h3>What is Ski Cross?</h3>
    <p>Ski Cross is a winter sport that mixes different disciplines and skills you may already know from traditional skiing. Whereas in most other ski and snowboard events the competitors are either timed or scored individually, in Ski Cross 4 skiers compete at the same time to get to the finishing line first.</p>

    <p>Ski Cross as a sport began in the 1970s in incorporates features from both downhill and freestyle skiing. While speed is most definitely of the essence there is a tactical element to the sport as you travel down the course with your competitors across jumps, rumble tracks and sharp, banked turns where gaining the optimal line and position is key.</p>

    <p>Ski Cross first made an appearance at the 2010 Winter Olympics and has since become one of the most anticipated and watched events in recent years. If high speeds, big jumps and a keen eye for the right racing line sound like your kind of thing then Ski Cross is definitely for you!
